- 👋 Hi, I’m Denise (@ko-ko-lo)
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development and UX/UI.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on a fun project, an Ukulele Tuner, and a heart project: a platform for Meditation, Breathwork and Yin-Style Yoga.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that combine Software Engineering and Design principles.
- ⚡ Fun fact: "Life is like a GitHub repository — progress only happens when you commit."
