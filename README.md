- 👋 Hi, I’m Denise (@ko-ko-lo)
- 👀 I’m interested in **Software Development** and UX/UI.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge of **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **Angular**, and learning **Java**. I’m also exploring **Figma Plugin Development** and expanding my skills in **Algorithms**, **Data Structures** and **Object-Oriented Programming**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that combine Design and Software Engineering principles.
- 📫 Based in Germany.
- ⚡ Fun fact: "After a long night of debugging, I always check for new gray hairs."
