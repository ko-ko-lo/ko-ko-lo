- 👋 Hi, I’m Denise (@ko-ko-lo)
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, UX/UI, and transitioning toward **Software Engineering** in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge of **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Angular**, and learning **Java**. I’m also exploring **Figma Plugin Development** and expanding my skills in **Algorithms**, **Data Structures** and **Object-Oriented Programming**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **Figma Plugin Development** or any projects that combine design and Software Engineering principles.
- 📫 Based in Germany, feel free to connect via GitHub Discussions.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: "The more I learn, the less I know!" – Always exploring new ways to challenge myself and grow.
