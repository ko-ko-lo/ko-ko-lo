- 👀 I’m interested in web development, UX/UI, and transitioning toward **software engineering** in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge of **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Angular**, and learning **Java**. I’m also exploring **Figma plugin development** and expanding my skills in **algorithms** and **object-oriented programming**.
- 💞️ **Figma Plugin Development** or any projects that combine design and software engineering principles.
- 📫 Feel free to connect via GitHub Discussions.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
